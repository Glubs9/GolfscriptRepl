# GolfscriptRepl
modification to the golfscript interpreter to make it act as a repl.                      

Here is the golfscript website (where I stole most of this code): golfscript.com                                 

the code I added (with the xception of removing the file argument) is at the bottom.                 

I have never coded in ruby before so my code isn't that great.                       

Originally I created this in python but the stack wasn't maintained throughout the repl so I had to hack this together.                 

To run this just run the file in ruby and it will do the repl.
